## Text Generation using LSTM ( Long Short Term Memory)

Text Generation is a type of Language Modelling problem. 

Language Modelling is the core problem for a number of of natural language processing tasks such as speech to text, conversational system, and text summarization. 

A trained language model learns the likelihood of occurrence of a word based on the previous sequence of words used in the text. Language models can be operated at character level, n-gram level, sentence level or even paragraph level. 

In the notebook attached, I have performed analysis on the reviews of the movies and their sentiment to train a text generation language model which can be used to generate reviews
